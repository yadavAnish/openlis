FINAL INTERPRETATION: These results most closely indicate the presence of HIV-2 antibodies. Confirmation testing for HIV-2 will be performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on this current specimen. Please submit another specimen one month following the collection of the first specimen for repeat testing.

UNINTERPRETABLE = Bands on Western Blot suggest possible HIV vaccine recipient.
POSITIVE = Specific cytoplasmic staining present. Patient is positive for anti-HIV-1 antibody.
NEGATIVE = No specific fluorescent staining present. Patient is negative for HIV-1 antibody.
INDETERMINATE = Non-specific staining present. Please submit another specimen.
NONREACTIVE = No anti-HIV-1 antibody detected.
POSITIVE = Any two of the following bands present: p24, gp41, and gp120/160. Other viral bands may be present. Indicates patient is positive for anti-HIV-1 antibody.
NEGATIVE = No bands present indicating absence of anti-HIV-1 antibody. Please submit another OraSure (or serum) sample one month following the first sample for repeat testing.
INDETERMINATE = Band pattern does not meet criteria for positive. Repeatedly similar indeterminate patterns indicate bands not specific for HIV. Please submit another OraSure (or serum) sample on month following the first sample for repeat testing.

One or more bands are present but the blot does not meet the criteria for a positive HIV-1 Western Blot result. NOTE: The HIV-1 Western Blot confirms the presence of antibodies to HIV. This test does not always distinguish between the antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 due to cross reactivity between the antibodies. If you suspect HIV-2, please contact the MDH Epidemiology at 877-676-5414 or 651-201-5414.
